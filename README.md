Project Description: Flutter CRUD App with Back4App (BaaS)
Project Title:
Task Manager App – A Flutter-Based CRUD Application Using Back4App (BaaS)
Project Overview:
This project is a Flutter-based Task Manager Application that utilizes Back4App as a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). Students will develop an app that enables user authentication and task management using a cloud backend without needing to build a custom server.
Why Use Back4App (BaaS)?
•	No need to set up or manage a backend manually.
•	Provides ready-to-use authentication and database services.
•	Offers real-time data storage and retrieval for the Flutter app.
•	Allows quick deployment and scalability.
Key Features:
✔ User Authentication – Register and login using a student email ID.
✔ CRUD Operations on Tasks – Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
✔ Backend as a Service (BaaS) – No need to write backend code, as Back4App handles data storage.
✔ Real-Time Database Syncing – Task updates are reflected dynamically.
✔ Secure Logout – Users can safely log out.
Technology Stack:
•	Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
